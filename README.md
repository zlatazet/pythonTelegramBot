Security and Threat Management
1. Token Management
It's important to keep the bot token secure. Never share it publicly or hardcode it directly into your code. Instead, use environment variables or a secure configuration file.

2. Authorization for Sensitive Commands
Some commands, such as sending messages to all users (/send_to_all), should only be accessible to authorized users. Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive commands.

3. Input Validation
Validate user input thoroughly to prevent malicious commands or unexpected behavior. Ensure that inputs for currency conversion, weather queries, and other features follow the expected formats.

4. Secure External API Usage
When interacting with external APIs, make sure to use secure endpoints (HTTPS) for data transmission. Avoid exposing sensitive information in API requests.

5. Rate Limiting
Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the bot's features. Limit the number of requests per user or per time period to avoid overwhelming external services.

6. Logging and Monitoring
Set up logging to track bot activities, errors, and potential security incidents. Monitor bot interactions for unusual patterns or suspicious behavior.

7. Regular Updates and Security Patches
Keep your bot and its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches. Regularly review and update your code to address any vulnerabilities or weaknesses.

8. Secure Data Handling
If your bot stores any user data or sensitive information, ensure it is stored securely. Use encryption and proper access controls to protect stored data from unauthorized access.
